# Libraries (if you copy them directly into the sketch folder)
# Be careful with this, usually libraries are installed globally
# but if you have a specific version or local copy, you might want to ignore.
# Eg:
# lib/

# IDE and OS specific files

# Sensitive data (YOUR WIFI CREDENTIALS!)
# You MUST comment out or delete your actual WiFi credentials before pushing.
# A better approach is to move them to a separate file that IS gitignored.
# For now, manually ensure they are not in the main sketch for public repos.
